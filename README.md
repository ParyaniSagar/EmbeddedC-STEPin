# EmbeddedC-STEPin

### The Activities performed in this reporsitory are divided into 4 Parts

#### Activity 1
To turn on LED when two switches are __ON__

#### Activity 2
To read the values of ADC with the help of Potentiometer.

#### Activity 3
To vary the PWM pulses based on the input ADC values.

#### Activity 4
to send the data serially usin UART protocol
